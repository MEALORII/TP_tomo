## The dataset
The data sets used for this exercise session are related to the paper "On the origin of the anisotropic damage of X100 line pipe steel, Part I: in-situ synchrotron tomography experiments" published by Madi et al. in Integrating Materials and Manufacturing Innovation. We will only use a few scans, but the complete dataset is available here:  [https://zenodo.org/record/3528199#.ZHb2OoTP02w](https://zenodo.org/record/3528199#.ZHb2OoTP02w).

In this study, the damage evolution of a grade X100 line pipe steel were investigated using in-situ synchrotron-radiation computed tomography (SRCT) of notched round bars (see Fig., right). Three scans (scan 01, scan 06 and scan 13, see Fig. left) will be used, they have been obtained on a specimens loaded along the rolling (L) direction. 

The first scan (scan 01) has been obtained in the early stage of elastic regime, and it will be used as the initial state (i.e. the minor Îµel is neglected). Scan 06 and scan 13 were obtained after significant void nucleation/growth and at the onset of the final coalescence stage that triggers catastrophic failure of the specimen, respectively.
